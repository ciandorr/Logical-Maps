## Premises

- **Rich Outcomes.** Every real number r occurs as a utility level of a sure outcome: for each r ∈ ℝ there is an outcome o_r with u(o_r)=r, with u defined by the normalized binary-mixture comparisons in the background. This does not assert that every outcome has a finite real level.
- **Totality.** For all gambles X,Y, either X ≽ Y or Y ≽ X.
- **Stochastic Equivalence.** If X and Y have the same probability law over outcomes, then X ~ Y. The variables remain distinct objects; indifference is an additional axiom.
- **Simple Expected Utility.** The normalized real utility chart u is defined on every outcome, is measurable, and ranks every pair of simple random variables exactly by finite expected utility: X ≽ Y iff E[u(X)] ≥ E[u(Y)]. Surjectivity of u is not included here.
- **Stochastic Dominance.** If P(X>o) ≥ P(Y>o) for every outcome threshold o, then X ≽ Y; if one threshold inequality is strict, X ≻ Y. Thresholds use the sure-outcome order.
- **Mixture Independence.** For all X,Y,Z and 0<p<1, X ≽ Y iff M_p(X,Z) ≽ M_p(Y,Z), where M is the fixed randomized-selection construction described in the background.
- **Negative Affine Anti-Invariance.** For all real a>0 and b, X ≽ Y iff −aY+b ≽ −aX+b.

## Conclusion

- **Alternating St Petersburg = −1/2.** Every X with P(u(X)=(−2)^n)=2^(−n), n≥1, is indifferent to sure utility −1/2.

## Proof

The law identity A =d M_1/2(−2,−2A) gives indifference by Stochastic Equivalence. If A≻−1/2 then −2A≺1, so Independence and Simple EU imply A~M_1/2(−2,−2A)≺M_1/2(−2,1)~−1/2, contradiction. The opposite strict case is analogous. Totality gives A~−1/2.

## Notes

Source-based result or immediate restriction/composition. Premises are sufficient; minimality is not claimed. The direct source is recorded separately from the transcription; no translation checker is asserted.
