## Premises

- **Rich Outcomes.** Every real number r occurs as a utility level of a sure outcome: for each r ∈ ℝ there is an outcome o_r with u(o_r)=r, with u defined by the normalized binary-mixture comparisons in the background. This does not assert that every outcome has a finite real level.
- **Totality.** For all gambles X,Y, either X ≽ Y or Y ≽ X.
- **Stochastic Equivalence.** If X and Y have the same probability law over outcomes, then X ~ Y. The variables remain distinct objects; indifference is an additional axiom.
- **Simple Expected Utility.** The normalized real utility chart u is defined on every outcome, is measurable, and ranks every pair of simple random variables exactly by finite expected utility: X ≽ Y iff E[u(X)] ≥ E[u(Y)]. Surjectivity of u is not included here.
- **Stochastic Dominance.** If P(X>o) ≥ P(Y>o) for every outcome threshold o, then X ≽ Y; if one threshold inequality is strict, X ≻ Y. Thresholds use the sure-outcome order.
- **Mixture Independence.** For all X,Y,Z and 0<p<1, X ≽ Y iff M_p(X,Z) ≽ M_p(Y,Z), where M is the fixed randomized-selection construction described in the background.
- **Negative Affine Anti-Invariance.** For all real a>0 and b, X ≽ Y iff −aY+b ≽ −aX+b.

## Conclusion

- **Uniqueness of Negative Self-Similarity.** Fix 0<p<1, a>0, b∈ℝ and Z. If X ~ M_p(−aX+b,Z) and Y ~ M_p(−aY+b,Z), then X ~ Y. This records the uniqueness-in-value content of Theorem 10.

## Proof

If X≻Y, negative affine anti-invariance makes −aX+b≺−aY+b. Independence with the common Z then reverses the strict comparison between their mixtures. The assumed fixed-point indifferences imply X≺Y, contradiction. Interchange X,Y for the other strict case and use Totality.

## Notes

Source-based result or immediate restriction/composition. Premises are sufficient; minimality is not claimed. The direct source is recorded separately from the transcription; no translation checker is asserted.
